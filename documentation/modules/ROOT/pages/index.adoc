== Accelerate the development of Spring Boot CRUD Apps on OpenShift

Learn cloud native aware Inner-loop Development Techniques to accelerate the development of Spring Boot CRUD applications for OpenShift.

This tutorial provides you with a super-simple CRUD microservice, *`FruitService`*, that implements the usual functions: create, update, delete, find all, etc. mapped to a table in a releational database.

No need to code this time, the Java code is simple it works and we have tested it against, H2, PostgreSQL and Oracle RDBMS.

So what will you do in this tutorial? Simple, you're going to:

* Deploy the code against PostgreSQL directly from the command line using the link:https://www.eclipse.org/jkube:[JKube] maven plugin
* You will learn how JKube leverages Source to Image (link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{oc-version}/builds/understanding-image-builds.html#builds-strategy-s2i-build_understanding-image-builds[S2I]) to speed up the process of building OCI images inside OpenShift.
* Finally we will show you how to use link:https://telepresence.io:[Telepresence] to speed up inner-loop development iterations.

Optionally, although highly recommendable, you will do the same but this time against an Oracle database. You will learn how to use a Kubernetes `Service` of type `ExternalName` to point to the Oracle database as if it were not deployed in your cluster, hence external. 

NOTE: No worries if you don't have an Oracle database at hand, we'll show you how you can have an Oracle database running in a container in your OpenShift cluster (for testing purposes and as long as you have an OTN developer account you can use to pull images from the Oracle Container Registry).

== Objectives of this lab

The main objective of this lab is to guide you through the cycle of developing cloud native applications stressing on the inner-loop, that is all the activities a developer so in his/her computer before actually pushing code to the repository.

In this particular case we have a Spring Boot CRUD application, so Java code and a database. Which database? Well we have decided to use *H2* for quick prototyping then *PostgreSQL* or *Oracle* once the code is deployed.

We'll explore different options to deploy and debug or test the code on OpenShift as well as locally.
